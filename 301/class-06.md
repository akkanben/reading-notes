2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
  - The V8 JavaScript engine is a program that compiles and executes JavaScript code, V8 uses just-in-time compiling to turn the script into machine code on the fly.

## Pair Programming

From the [Code Fellows article](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

### Questions


1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
  - Greater Efficiency
  - Engaged Collaboration
  - Learning from Fellow Students
  - Social Skills
  - Job Interview Readiness
  - Work Environment Readiness
2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
  - I've found pair programming to be beneficial by learning from fellow students. Collaborating with someone often brings up ideas I'd not thought of or approaches to solving a problem I might not have tried.
3. How does pair programming work?
  - Typically there is a driver who writes codes and physically operates the computer. The other person takes the role of navigator and guides the driver with words, thinks about the bigger picture, watches out for typos and bugs, they might look up documentation as well.

- Async and await in practice.
- Why to use one version of Node.js over another -- why are we using v14 lts via npx and not v16 lts?
