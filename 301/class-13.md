Reading Notes 13 - Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

From [NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

## Questions

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
  - Advertisements for home computers were targeting boys and marketing them as toys.
2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
  - A huge amount of familiarity with home computers was assumed even in entry level computer science classes. This created a barrier for those who grew up without a home computer.

## Questions

1. What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?
  - I think this data would be even more interesting if it salary information and how these gender and ethnicity percentages change when compared with different tiers in the company (i.e. entry level up to CEO). 
  - Amazon's 39% female workforce seems bad but if you look at this [Vox.com](https://www.vox.com/2017/10/21/16512448/amazon-gender-diversity-leadership-executives-jeff-bezos) article it gets worse, in the same year of the chart data (2017) within the top 18 most powerful executives there is only one woman -- that's 5.56%.
  - Hiring internally, overvaluing internal references and a history of educational gate-keeping are likely big contributers to the white-male dominated industry. It's too bad the diversity found in tech company's modern advertisements are not in line with the current state of their workforce -- especially the higher paying positions.

## Questions

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
  - When the company leaders actually care about it and make a meaningful commitment.
2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
  - Diverse teams bring more points of view and in turn different ways of viewing problems and faster/better ways of solving them.
3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
  - A gender diverse video game company would be more likely to offer user character avatar options that match the identities of their customers. Less likely to arbitrarily limit hairstyles, makeup, clothing, pronouns, or other commonly gender locked features.

## Things I want to know more about

- The NPR article/audio segment was interesting. I'd like to read more about how the educational gate-keeping started and what other factors lead to the current state of diversity in tech.
