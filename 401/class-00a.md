Deliberate practice means repeatedly challenging yourself with problems that mentally demanding. You should come away having learned something new. It can be easy to get comfortable at work solving similar problems and getting used to them. Pushing yourself out of your comfort zone will help you upgrade your technical skills.

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

From the Ted Talk [The power of believing that you can improve](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en)

Maintaining a growth mindset is critical in learning. Our minds are not fixed and if we push ourselves and put in the effort we can grow. Using the phrase "not yet" is an empowering way to talk about a failure. A positive outlook and believing in yourself goes a long way towards a learning goal.

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

From the Ted Talk [Grit: The power of passion and perseverance](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance)

> Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint. 

Angela Lee Duckworth found that success in achieving goals has more to do with grit than IQ or social intelligence. Having grit is also typically coupled with a growth mindset.

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

From the Ted Talk [A kinder, gentler philosophy of success](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success)

> What is a snob? A snob is anybody who takes a small part of you, and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are. That is snobbery. 

> Envy, it's a real taboo to mention envy, but if there's one dominant emotion in modern society, that is envy. And it's linked to the spirit of equality. 

Alain de Botton spent most of the TED Talk speaking about modern life. Snobbery and envy are two prevailing issues that have a big effect on our perception of success and failure. He also spoke about the unachievable idea of a meritocratic society -- one in which trying hard and doing well is directly related to your position in society. 

Botton also suggests there is something important to learn from Tragic art to balance our expectations of success and failure.

> Here's an insight that I've had about success: You can't be successful at everything. We hear a lot of talk about work-life balance. Nonsense. You can't have it all. You can't. So any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on, where the element of loss is. And I think any wise life will accept, as I say, that there is going to be an element where we're not succeeding. 

We are also easily influenced by society when it comes to defining success. Botton suggest digging deeper at what success means and allowing for ideas of success that are atypical.
