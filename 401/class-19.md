# Reading Notes 19 -- Spring and Sockets AKA Purely Functional Programming

From the [Wikipedia article on Purely Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming)

## Functional Programming

Purely functional programming is programming paradigm that treats all computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. Also changes in state and mutable data are forbidden.

- In functional programming a function should always return the same results and shouldn't be susceptible to changes or reliant in outside data.
- The order of evaluation should not effect the results of a function.
- Functional programming simplifies parallel computing since purely functional parts of the evaluation do not interact.
- Maps and random-access-lists are used in purely functional programming over arrays.
