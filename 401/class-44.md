# Reading Notes 44 -- Ethics in Tech

From [New York Times article](https://web.archive.org/web/20211124172013/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/technology/tech-companies-immigration-border.html)

In the Summer of 2018 one of the biggest news stories was President Trump's "zero tolerance" border policy. This included many heartbreaking stories and images of families separated at the southern border. Employees at Microsoft signed a letter in protest of Microsoft's involvement with ICE, specifically a $19.4 million dollar contract. I personally thing ICE should absolutely be abolished and Microsoft has no moral way of doing business with ICE. It's not enough for Nadella to condemn the actions that are taking place at the border because it happened to be in the news. I think corporations should hold their inspiring mission statements in higher regard than their shareholder's wishes.

From [Solve for Interesting's article](http://solveforinteresting.com/big-data-is-our-generations-civil-rights-issue-and-we-dont-know-it/)

The way that big data is used is definitely a civil rights issue. I'm positive the examples in this article only begin to scratch the surface on the many many ways big data is impacting decisions being made based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion. Since we can clearly not rely on corporations to use big data with any kind of moral principles it will likely be up to the government to develop functional policy. Unfortunately moving quickly and understanding technology is not really what I would categorize as our government's strong suit.
