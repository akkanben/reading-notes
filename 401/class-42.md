# Reading Notes 41 -- Monetization and AdMob Ads

AdMob is a monetization option from Google. The Google Mobile Ads SDK allows for a few different ad formats:

- Banner ads that stay on the screen while users interact with the application, usually a rectangle at the top or bottom of the screen.
- Interstitial ads cover part of the app until the user closes them.
- Native ads are customizable.
- Rewarded are ads that block the app until a video or time limit has passed, "rewarding" the user with your app.

AdMob requires an account and an active ad unit.
